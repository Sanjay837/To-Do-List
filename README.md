# To-Do-List
To-Do-List
We are going to build a simple To-Do List website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website will have the following features:
Add a new task.
Mark a task as completed.
Delete a task.
Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed).
We'll structure the project in three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
Let's start by creating the HTML structure.

Interactive To-Do List Website
I'll create a clean, modern, and fully functional to-do list application with all the essential features. Here's the complete code for a single HTML file that includes everything needed

Features of this To-Do List:
Clean, Modern Design - Attractive gradient header and intuitive interface

Add Tasks - Simply type and press Enter or click the Add button

Task Management:

Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with checkboxes

Edit tasks by clicking the edit button or double-clicking the task text

Delete tasks with the delete button

Filtering - View all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks

Statistics - See total tasks and completed count

Persistence - Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage

Responsive Design - Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

Empty States - Helpful messages when no tasks are present

To use this to-do list, simply copy the entire code into an HTML file and open it in your browser. The application will work completely offline and save your tasks automatically.
